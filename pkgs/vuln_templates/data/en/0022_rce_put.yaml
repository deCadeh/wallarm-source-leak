:description         : This vulnerability is due to settings in the web server that allow
  any internet user to upload arbitrary files. The attacker could exploit the vulnerability to download
  executable interpreter files onto the web server, resulting in their ablity to execute arbitrary code.

:additional          : To fix the vulnerability, the PUT method should be denied for HTTP requests by configuring the web server.<p/> In cases where this file load method is required, authorization should be used.<p/>
