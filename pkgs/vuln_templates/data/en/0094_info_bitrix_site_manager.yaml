:description         : >
  Vulnerability is caused by the absence of restricted access to the system testing file. Web-app can be redirected to connect to a fake SQL server by an attacker. Once fake SQL server is connected it will return a reading operator of random local client's files (LOAD DATA). The attacker that controls fake SQL server can get access to the source code of the web-app, configuration files and other technical data.

:additional          : >
  In order to eliminate vulnerability it is necessary to either deny access to the file via internet connection or delete the file. Then turn off the 'reading local files' option in a DBMS client.
