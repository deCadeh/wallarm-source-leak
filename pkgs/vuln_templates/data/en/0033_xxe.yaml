:description         : >
  This vulnerability is due to incorrect settings in the XML documents parsing library.
  The DTD section of the XML documents allows the use of external entities. External entities can refer
  to local files or network resources whose content will be implemented in an XML document. As a result,
  a malicious user is able to read local files as well as data on the network services within the network.
  Furthermore, the path to an XML document of the external entity resource may contain a URI scheme that will be
  processed by a third-party library, which can lead to a variety of consequences. For example, in the case
  of PHP with PECL extension, connection of an entity at URI 'expect://ls' will execute the 'ls' command of the command line.

:additional          : >
  <p>To eliminate the vulnerability, disable the function to load external entities during XML library initialization.
  </p><p>It should be noted that malicious users will often use this vulnerability to provoke a denial of service through reading large files such as '/dev/urandom' or similar ones.<p>
