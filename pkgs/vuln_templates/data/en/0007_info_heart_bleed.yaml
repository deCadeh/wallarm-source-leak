:title               : OpenSSL 'Heartbleed' vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160) at the node '<%= self.ip %>:<%= self.port %>'

:description         : The vulnerability is due to the use of an outdated version of
  the OpenSSL library. The malicious user could obtain up to 64KB of the web server's memory
  as a response to a specially formed request. The data (user names, passwords, session IDs, etc.)
  of the clients who are currenty connected to the server are in the web server memory. The attacker
  could gain access to virtually the entire web server memory through a repeating memory read operation
  for an extended time period.

:additional          : <p>To fix the vulnerability, OpenSSL should be updated to the latest version.</p><p>This vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.0.1f.</p><p>To run an example of this exploit, you could use <a href='https://github.com/wallarm/heartbleed.py/blob/master/heartbleed.py'>this script</a>.</p>
