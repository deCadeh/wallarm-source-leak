:title               : Cache poisoning

:description         : >
  This vulnerability exists due to incorrect logic in the caching mechanism, in which the domain specified as the “Host” header gets into the response from the web application server. An attacker could generate such a request, where the response would contain a link to a malicious resource that would be cached. Using a technique called Cache Poisoning, the attacker can reach website users, replacing links or executing arbitrary JavaScript code that is hosted on this resource.
