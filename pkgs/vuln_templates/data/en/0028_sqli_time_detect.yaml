:description         : This vulnerability is due to the absence of SQL syntax special characters filtering
  when the user data goes from the parameter '<%= self.parameter %>' to the DBMS request. The malicious user can
  change the request structure and introduce operators, thus giving the request certain logic to bypass
  the web application's functionality. As a result, the attacker can gain access to the database
  content and disrupt the performance of the web application.

:additional          : To fix the vulnerability, template queries (prepared statements) should be used when accessing the DBMS.<p/> In some cases, it is allowed to use special functions to filter data, such as <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php">mysql_real_escape_string()</a><p/>

:exploit_example     : ! 'The vulnerability was found through the pattern matching of the web server response time and the value of the argument in the time delay function of the vectors attacks requests.
  below:


  1. The server response to the first request was received within <%= self.time1 %> seconds:

  <%= self.curl1 %>


  2. The server response to the second request was received within <%= self.time2 %> seconds:

  <%= self.curl2 %>'
