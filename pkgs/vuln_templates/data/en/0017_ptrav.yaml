:description         : This vulnerability is due to the absence of specific file system name characters filtering
  when using the user data as part of the path or file name. As a result, the malicious user can perform operations
  with files located in the directories other than the one allowed according to the web application logic.
  In order to change directories, the attacker can use the double point symbols (/../).

:additional          : <p>To eliminate this vulnerability, the data received from the parameter should be filtered '<%= self.parameter %>' after their substitution in the file name variable.</p><p>The file name should be given its canonical form (without relative paths).</p><p>Also, the elimination of the vulnerability may be accomplished by filtering the special pathname characters (/ \\ ..) in the parameter '<%= self.parameter %>.'</p>
