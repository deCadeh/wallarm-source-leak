:description         : >
  This vulnerability exists due to an incorrect value of location directives in the Nginx server configuration file. By using a specially crafted request, an attacker could exit the current directory and gain access to the source code or configuration files of the web application.

  To fix the vulnerability, the resulting path and file name should be transformed to canonical form and validated after user input. It is enough to add either '/' at the end of the location line or not to use the '/' sign in both cases (location and alias) if thatâ€™s necessary for the correct operation of the web application. You can also resolve the vulnerability by filtering special characters in file paths ( / \ ).. ) in user data before their use by the application.
