:title               : The disclosure of the DNS zone via AXFR requests at the node '<%= self.domain %>'

:description         : The vulnerability is due to incorrect DNS server settings '<%= self.domain %>'.
  The malicious user can send an AXFR request to the server and receieve the full content
  of the DNS zone. DNS records can be used by the attacker to gather information about
  both the network perimeter of the organization and its infrastructure. In addition,
  malicious users often use this vulnerability to conduct DDoS attacks due to
  the high ratios of request/response packets.

:additional          : To eliminate the vulnerability, one must configure the DNS server to ban AXFR query processing.
