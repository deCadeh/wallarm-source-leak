:description         : >
  This vulnerability is caused by incorrect logic in a web server response caching mechanism.

  As a result, data from the HTTP HOST header of one web-app request might show up as a web-app response to another HTTP request.

  The vulnerable app will use the cached domain name from the first HTTP request in absolute links ("&lt;a href=&gt;", "&lt;script src=&gt;", etc.) to send HTTP responses to other requests.

  An attacker can manipulate content that is connected to the vulnerable web-app by controlling the domain with the cached name.
  This particular attack technique is called "cache poisoning."

  As a result, an attacker can compromise a victim and run random JavaScript code in a browser context.
