:title               : The absence of restrictions to information at the cross-domain access on the site through the Adobe Flash components

:description         : This vulnerability is due to incorrect settings in the cross-domain interactions
  configuration file for the Adobe Flash components. The current configuration in the crossdomain.xml
  file allows any third-party resources to obtain information from the vulnerable site without any restrictions.
  The attacker could exploit this error to obtain personal information from the vulnerable site.

:additional          : To eliminate the vulnerability, edit the crossdomain.xml file so that the "domain" section contains a list of allowed sites.<p/> Currently, the section contains the "*" symbol, which allows reading confidential information from any websites.<p/>
