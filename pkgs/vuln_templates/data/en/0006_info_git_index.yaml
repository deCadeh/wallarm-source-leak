:title               : Access to the source code through the GIT repository

:description         : The vulnerability is due to the possibility of accessing the GIT source code
  repository directory via the web. The malicious user can gain access to the source codes of
  web applications and use this information for further attacks. Most often, web application
  source codes are used by the attackers to gain access (keys, usernames, and passwords) to
  the databases, as well as for research to detect other vulnerabilities.

:additional          : To eliminate the vulnerability, access to the .git directory and to all of its subdirectories has to be closed by configuring the web server.
