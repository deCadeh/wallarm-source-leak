:description         : This vulnerability is due to the absence of address verification in the user redirection
  functionality. The vulnerability could be exploited by the malicious user to send the victim to a malicious
  resource under the guise of a trusted site. Open redirects are used for phishing attacks. It is assumed
  that the victim opens a specially created link to a trusted resource. This link will contain a vector for
  redirect exploitation, which actually is already a new link to a malicious resource, visually similar to
  the original one. Thus, with the help of this vulnerability, the malicious user could elicit
  some sensitive data from the user (such as user name and password or credit card details). Also, open redirects
  are actively used in spam mailings to distribute malware. In this case, the antivirus software may mark the fragile
  site as malicious, which will lower its ranking in search engines.

:additional          : <p>To eliminate the vulnerability, check the address to which the redirect will be made as per the list of allowed sites.</p><p>If the node is not on the list, you should disable the automatic redirect, replacing it with, for example, a user alert of moving to a third-party resource.</p>
