:description         : Apache server incorrectly resolves conflicts between .htaccess files located on different levels (for example, a specific directory and a global .htaccess file of the server). As a result, fragments of memory data show up in the response header ALLOW. That gives the potential intruder an opportunity to take advantage of collected technical data for further attacks.

:additional          : To eliminate this vulnerability, update Apache to the latest version.
