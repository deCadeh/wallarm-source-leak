:title               : Access to the file '<%= self.file_name %>' of hardware settings via TFTP at the node '<%= self.ip %>:<%=
  port %>'

:description         : <p>The vulnerability is due to the lack of network limitations while accessing the TFTP
  service from the internet.</p><p>TFTP protocol is typically used to read and write the settings of various equipment,
  such as network devices or network server load.</p><p>The protocol does not provide client authentication, so the
  service must be available only on the company's internal network.</p><p>In this case, the file sharing server is
  accessible from the internet, and the attacker can gain access to the configuration file "<%= self.file_name%>."</p>

:additional          : To resolve this vulnerability, access from the internet should be denied to port "<%= self.port %>" of the node "<%= self.ip %>."
