:description         : The vulnerability is due to the absence of HTTP header special characters separator
  the user data gets in the server response. The attacker can create an HTTP request that will add
  a custom header to the HTTP server response. Sending such a request from the target user's browser
  will lead to a cross-site scripting attack. As a result, the attacker can gain access to data or
  perform actions on the compromised site on behalf of the user without his consent.

:additional          : To eliminate this vulnerability, execute new line and carriage return filtering (0x0a, 0x0d) in the user data.<p/>
