:title               : Inconsistent network restrictions configuration for IPv4 and IPv6 node address '<%= self.domain %>'

:description         : This vulnerability is due to different network restriction settings for one node on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
  As a result, some services that are closed from external access on an IPv4 address may be available on IPv6 and vice versa.
  Thus, the malicious user can bypass the restrictions and obtain network access to the services.

:additional          : "
                       The network resource located at '<%= self.domain %>' has the following A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) DNS records:
                       <ul>
                         <li><%= self.ipv4 %></li>
                         <li><%= self.ipv6 %></li>
                       </ul>
                       There are more network services available on the internet at the '<%= self.ipv6 %>' address than at IPv4:
                       <ul>
                       <% self.ports.each do |prt|%>
                       <li><%= prt %></li>
                       <% end %>
                       </ul>
