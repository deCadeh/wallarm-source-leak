:title           : SMTP Open Relay on node '<%= self.ip %>:<%= self.port %>'

:description     : Vulnerability is caused by an incorrect setup of the SMTP server's settings. As a result an anonymous user is allowed to send mail. An attacker can use open relays for unsolicited bulk email (UBE/spam) or for a denial of service attack (DoS) on other mailing systems. Open relays are often included in a list of spamming domains despite the fact whether such activity was ever noticed or not.

:additional      : In order to eliminate this vulnerability it is mandatory to allow relaying only from authenticated users.
