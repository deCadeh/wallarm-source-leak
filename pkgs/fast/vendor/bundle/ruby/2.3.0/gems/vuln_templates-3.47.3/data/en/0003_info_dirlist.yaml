  '<%= self.path %>'. As a result, the malicious user can get the list of files located in the directory and their content.
  Information in the web directory files is particularly sensitive in the case of event log files and configuration
  settings (configuration files), as well as in temporary files and files with caching results.

:additional          : To eliminate the vulnerability, it is necessary to prevent unauthenticated access from viewing the contents of a directory.
