:title               : Missing "Strict-Transport-Security" header in server's response at '<%= self.ip %>:<%= self.port %>'

:description         : >
  This vulnerability exists due to the absence of the "Strict-Transport-Security" header in the server's response.
  The interaction mechanism between client and server via SSL does not use the protective HSTS profile
  (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to transform all HTTP links to HTTPS links. The absence of this
  header allows an attacker to redirect the victim from HTTPS to HTTP via a man-in-the-middle attack.
  In this case, all the data from the client to server will be transferred without encryption and will be
  available to the attacker (including the authorization via login/password and cookies, even with the
  httpOnly flag). Using the "Strict-Transport-Security" header in the HTTP server response provides
  activation of the HSTS profile in all modern browsers.

:additional          : >
  To fix the vulnerability, you should configure your web server to send the "Strict-Transport-Security" header in the response.
  Here is an example of a correct HSTS header:

  <code>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains</code>

  <i>max-age</i> is a period of profile expiration (31536000 is one year). The <i>includeSubDomains</i> directive applies this profile to the subdomains.
