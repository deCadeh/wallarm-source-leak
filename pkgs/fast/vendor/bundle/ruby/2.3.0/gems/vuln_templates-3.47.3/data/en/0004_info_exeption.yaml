:description         : The vulnerability is due to an incorrect application server configuration. Application error messages
  go to the HTTP user responses, where they can be accessed by the attacker. The attacker could use this information to study
  the application technology stack and carry out further attacks. Error information often contains class names of the components
  used, the full file paths, and in some cases the content of variables, including those concerning configuration.

:additional          : To fix the vulnerability, disable web application error messages in the HTTP responses to users.
