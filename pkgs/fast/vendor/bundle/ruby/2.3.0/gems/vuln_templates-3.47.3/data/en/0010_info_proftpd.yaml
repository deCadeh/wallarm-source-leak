:title               : The CVE-2015-3306 vulnerability of the ProFTPD file server at the node '<%= self.ip %>:<%= self.port %>'

:description         : This vulnerability is due to the use of an outdated version of the ProFTPD file server.
  The attacker can copy arbitrary files on the server to arbitrary directories even without authorization.
  This vulnerability is of particular danger when the file server is running at the same node as a web server.
  In this case, the attacker can copy the log file to any available directory of the web server under a different
  name with an extension of an executable file (for instance, .php). The event log file will contain information
  from the attacker&apos;s previous queries, which can be used as an executable shell language script (e.g., PHP).
  As a result, the attacker may be able to execute an arbitrary interpreter code through the web server.

:additional          : To fix the vulnerability, the file server needs to be updated to the latest version. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.3.6.
