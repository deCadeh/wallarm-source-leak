:title               : Authentication bypass via a fake X-Forwarded-For header at the node '<%= self.ip %>:<%= self.port %>'

:description         : The vulnerability is due to a Web server configuration error. The attacker could falsify
  the sender's address by sending an HTTP header X-Forwarded-For, or a similar one, and, as a consequence, bypass
  the authentication system. The Web server checks the username and password only if the user address does not
  matchthe local server address. The attacker can specify the local address in the header and bypass the username
  and password verification.

:additional          : <p>To resolve this vulnerability, the client&apos;s address receipt from HTTP request headers should be forbidden.</p><p>The client&apos;s address must be obtained from the network connection.</p>
